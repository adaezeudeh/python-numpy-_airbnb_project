# python-numpy-_airbnb_project
Amsterdam is a city with a long history and a rich international culture, so there is always something interesting to see and do. What if you were to visit Amsterdam? You'd probably want to have your Airbnb close to your favorite spot! This project takes your chosen spot and highlights airbnbs close to that area showing the prices in your chosen currency as well!

I used NumPy to clean, read, and process data then used the location data to make an interactive app.
